## Hello World!

I'm not a tech nerd, but if there's a problem, I will find a way to code the solution.

I am a problem-solver with a passion for software engineering. Coding is more than just a skill for me, itâ€™s a powerful tool for creating meaningful change in the world. What I love the most about coding is the opportunity to help people. Whether itâ€™s crafting seamless user experiences or efficient and scalable backend systems, I focus on creating software that truly makes a difference. Knowing that my work can help someone achieve their goals or simplify a task is what motivates me to keep coding and improving.

I specialize in backend development, particularly with Python, Django, and Flask. Iâ€™ve worked on building scalable web applications, developing RESTful APIs, and integrating backend systems with seamless database management. I am also familiar with JavaScript and React for frontend and have a solid understanding of C++ and Java. Nonetheless, I am always on the lookout to grow my skillset.
